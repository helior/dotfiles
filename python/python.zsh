## Install Python
## NOTE: Use v3.8 at minimum; 3.7 for instance is not supported on Apple M1.

# ‚úÖ Do a sanity-check
# `which python`

# IF /usr/bin/python ‚Üí This is default Mac OS X System üëåüèº

# `which python3`
# IF /usr/local/bin/python3 ‚Üí Most likely you installed this with Homebrew,
# particularly if `ls -la /usr/local/bin/py*` symlinks to Celler paths.

# Next steps: get Pip, and figure out what is the recommended PATH if I have python3 from Homebrew

# Troubleshooting


### Add Python binaries to PATH
# export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.7/bin:$PATH"
# export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/2.7/bin:$PATH"
# export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.6/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.8/bin:$PATH"
# export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin:$PATH"


# -----Install Steps + tools (Apr 26, 2020)-----
# ‚¨õÔ∏è brew install python@3.8
# Install latest pip within your venv
# ‚¨õÔ∏è python -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
# ‚¨õÔ∏è pip3 install --user virtualenv
# ‚¨õÔ∏è virtualenv --version
# ‚¨õÔ∏è virtualenv venv ## being practical



## Force Python3. Use `command python` to access original binary
alias python=python3
## Freudian slip, maybe?
alias pythong="python"

## Show a quick diff when re-generating the requirements.txt
## FIXME: this doesn't rm the file at the end because diff exits with 1 (as
## expected, Diff(1) returns 1 when differences are found)
## TODO: recursively travel up the folder tree until you find `requirements.txt`
alias pipf="cp requirements.txt requirements.old.txt && pip3 freeze > requirements.txt && diff --unified=5 requirements.old.txt requirements.txt; rm requirements.old.txt"
alias pa="source venv/bin/activate && echo 'üêç Python Virtualenv Activated!!'"
alias pd="deactivate && echo 'üêç Python Deactivated ‚ùå'"
alias pi="python -m pip install -r requirements.txt"

## My little Django app helper
pm() {
  python3 manage.py $@
}

## More Django reminders to myself:
# Django uses a LOT of scaffolding scripts. And "chore" scripts. Ugh.

# This one handles changes in the app models...
# `python manage.py migrate`

# And this one creates a new app...
# `python manage.py startapp APP_NAME`

# And this on "inits" new app in DB...
# `python manage.ph makemigrations`
# `python manage.py migrate`

# And this on creates the root user...
# `python manage.py createsuperuser`

# And then you can login and administrate üòé http://localhost:8080/admin

# When you forget your password, run this command to reset it.
# `python manage.py changepassword <user_name>`


# Installing brew openssl (@1.1.1); brew link openssl --force told me to do it, and I was trying to fix installing cryptography for python@3.8.2
# export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
# export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
